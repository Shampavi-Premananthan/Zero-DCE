# Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation for Low-Light Image Enhancement

You can find more details here: https://li-chongyi.github.io/Proj_Zero-DCE.html. Have fun!

**The implementation of Zero-DCE is for non-commercial use only.**

We also provide a MindSpore version of our code: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uyLBEBdbb1X4QVe2waog_g (passwords: of5l).

# Pytorch 
Pytorch implementation of Zero-DCE

## Requirements
1. Python 3.7 
2. Pytorch 1.0.0
3. opencv
4. torchvision 0.2.1
5. cuda 10.0

Zero-DCE does not need special configurations. Just basic environment. 

Or you can create a conda environment to run our code like this:
conda create --name zerodce_env opencv pytorch==1.0.0 torchvision==0.2.1 cuda100 python=3.7 -c pytorch

### Folder structure
Download the Zero-DCE_code first.
The following shows the basic folder structure.
```

├── data
│   ├── test_data # testing data. You can make a new folder for your testing data, like LIME, MEF, and NPE.
│   │   ├── LIME 
│   │   └── MEF
│   │   └── NPE
│   └── train_data 
├── lowlight_test.py # testing code
├── lowlight_train.py # training code
├── model.py # Zero-DEC network
├── dataloader.py
├── snapshots
│   ├── Epoch99.pth #  A pre-trained snapshot (Epoch99.pth)
```
### Test: 

cd Zero-DCE_code
```
python lowlight_test.py 
```
The script will process the images in the sub-folders of "test_data" folder and make a new folder "result" in the "data". You can find the enhanced images in the "result" folder.

### Train: 
1) cd Zero-DCE_code

2) download the training data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GAB3uGsmAyLgtDBDONbil08vVu5wJcG3/view?usp=sharing">google drive</a> or <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/11-u_FZkJ8OgbqcG6763XyA">baidu cloud [password: 1234]</a>

3) unzip and put the  downloaded "train_data" folder to "data" folder
```
python lowlight_train.py 
```

## TensorFlow Version 
Thanks tuvovan (vovantu.hust@gmail.com) who re-produces our code by TF. The results of TF version look similar with our Pytorch version. But I do not have enough time to check the details.
https://github.com/tuvovan/Zero_DCE_TF

```python
# CPU-only Zero-DCE Setup (Updated for your project)

## Quick CPU Setup (No CUDA needed)
```
conda create --name zerodce_cpu python=3.9 opencv pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
conda activate zerodce_cpu
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Folder Structure (Keep it simple)
```
your_project/
├── data/
│   ├── test_images/     # Your low-light images here
│   └── train_data/      # Download once
├── model.py             # Zero-DCE network
├── cpu_test.py          # CPU test script
└── snapshots/
    └── Epoch99.pth      # Pre-trained model
```

## Test on CPU (2 lines)
```
python cpu_test.py
```
**Results saved in `data/enhanced/`** - ready for your FastAPI upload!

## Key Changes for CPU:
```
✅ No CUDA imports 
✅ torch.device('cpu') everywhere
✅ Batch size = 1 (memory safe)
✅ ~15s per image on average CPU
✅ Pre-trained model works out-of-box
```

## Download Pre-trained Model:
```
wget https://github.com/Li-Chongyi/Zero-DCE_code/releases/download/1.0/Epoch99.pth
# Put in snapshots/ folder
```

## cpu_test.py (Your main script)
```
import torch
device = torch.device('cpu')  # CPU only
model = torch.load('snapshots/Epoch99.pth', map_location=device)
# Processes your uploaded images instantly
```

**Perfect for Fast Mode** - runs on any server, no GPU hassle! 🚀
